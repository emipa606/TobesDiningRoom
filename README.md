Update of totobrothers mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1184694645

- Should no longer conflict with the fountain from https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=836308268]Dubs Bad Hygiene. If you build a fountain before adding Dubs mod it will be replaced with a drinking fountain on first load. Also added plumbing and water-storage to the fountain.
- Fixed the table-textures. Now pawns wont try to eat beside the table-surface
- Russian translation added, thanks Dmitry6!
